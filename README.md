`RostersGG` is an all-in-one tool that helps amateur Esports teams succeed.


**Why RostersGG**
---
Before RostersGG, there were no free apps for Esports teams to use to keep track of player rosters, schedule events like practices and scrimmages, and find new teams to play against. Delete those excel spreadsheets and use your management time wisely with RostersGG!


**Tech Stack**
---
RostersGG is built with the following technologies:
- [React](https://reactjs.org) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for frontend
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the backend
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usagewithreact) for state management between React components


**Educational**
---
I decided to open source this project because I no longer have time to work on it. I wanted to show some of my frontend and backend engineering skills as well as give other students some boilerplate code that they can use if they want to build a similar app.


**Steps To Setup Dev Environment**
---
// Install dependencies for server & client
npm install && npm run client-install

// Run client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

// Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
